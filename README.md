# Learning-Python
This repository is about learning Python as a software developer student and also sharing what I am learning with those who are interested or those who might benefit from it.So in this repo I start at the basics of python, there will be pdfs of my summaries and also python scripts with comments in code.
The Structure Of This Repo(From A.I suggestions):

1. Core Python Fundamentals:
- Syntax: Variables, data types (numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries), operators, expressions, control flow (if-else, loops).
- Functions: Defining and calling functions, arguments, return values, scope.
- Modules and Packages: Organizing code, importing modules, creating packages.
- Input and Output: Working with user input, file I/O operations.
- Exception Handling: Identifying and handling errors gracefully.
  
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
- Classes and Objects: Creating blueprints for objects, attributes, methods.
- Inheritance: Reusing code, creating hierarchies.
- Polymorphism: Different behaviors for objects of the same class.
- Encapsulation: Data hiding and protection.
  
3. Data Structures and Algorithms:
- Built-in Data Structures: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets.
- Algorithm Design: Problem-solving techniques, sorting, searching, recursion.

4. Libraries and Frameworks:
- Standard Library: os, sys, math, datetime, json, urllib, random.
- Data Science and Machine Learning: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
- Web Development: Django, Flask.

5. Database Integration:
- SQL Libraries: psycopg2, MySQL Connector, SQLAlchemy.
- Object Relational Mappers (ORMs): SQLAlchemy.

6. Web Scraping:
- Libraries: Beautiful Soup, requests.
- Ethical considerations and best practices

7. Testing and Debugging:
- Unit Testing: Writing and running tests to ensure code correctness.
- Debugging: Identifying and fixing errors.
